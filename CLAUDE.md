# Working on wilanis

This is the `@wilanis/*` workspace: ten npm packages, one example project, and a test directory beside each package that has one. Read this
before changing anything; it says where things live and which direction dependencies may point.

## Layout

```
packages/engine/       @wilanis/engine     spec.ts kernel.ts run.ts plan.ts sources.ts redact.ts   depends on nothing
packages/core/         @wilanis/core       model registry types assign values generate expr/ templates scope load documents placement paths validate plugin, schemas/   → engine
packages/compiler/     @wilanis/compiler   checker.ts check/<family>.ts compiler.ts lower.ts env.ts refusals.ts sites.ts documents.ts   → core, engine
packages/runtime/      @wilanis/runtime    embed tools branches serve(start) project cli, plugins/{std,cli-trigger}, docs/{std,cli}, bin/, templates/   → core, engine, compiler
packages/plugin-http/  @wilanis/plugin-http  index.ts codecs.ts throttle.ts, docs/  → core, engine
packages/plugin-blob/  @wilanis/plugin-blob  index.ts, docs/                        → core, engine
packages/plugin-reload/ @wilanis/plugin-reload  index.ts, docs/                     → core, engine
packages/plugin-auth/  @wilanis/plugin-auth  index.ts store.ts, docs/               → core, engine   (the guard: tokens, sessions, challenges, directories)
packages/plugin-storage/ @wilanis/plugin-storage  index.ts engine.ts store.ts where.ts handlers.ts suite.ts, docs/   → core, engine   (records behind one port; an engine plugin keeps them)
packages/plugin-storage-memory/ @wilanis/plugin-storage-memory  index.ts engine.ts match.ts, docs/   → core, engine, plugin-storage   (an engine: records in a Map, for as long as the process)
packages/plugin-storage-postgres/ @wilanis/plugin-storage-postgres  index.ts engine.ts ensure.ts filter.ts columns.ts names.ts pool.ts rules.ts, docs/   → core, engine, plugin-storage   (an engine: records in PostgreSQL, through Kysely)
packages/view/         @wilanis/view       model.ts serve.ts cli.ts, client/index.html, bin/   → core, compiler, runtime
libraries/access/      @wilanis/access     a tree to include: features/access (sign-in, sessions, policies, otp), features/access-dev (its own binding), connections/, project.json, test/
example/               a consumer project: JSON documents + package.json; includes @wilanis/access and binds its identity port in features/directories
reserved/wilanis/      a name held on npm with no code under it; not a workspace member, never built (reserved/README.md)
```

Dependencies point one way: engine ← core ← compiler ← runtime ← view, and plugins depend on core and
engine only. The viewer is a tool over a loaded tree, not a plugin: it grants nothing to a tree and
executes nothing; `viewOf` is pure and the page under `client/` is one static file with no build step. A plugin never imports the compiler or the runtime. One plugin may import another only where that other is a **contract** it implements -- `@storage` says what a store is and an engine plugin answers it -- and the contract imports no engine, so the arrow still points one way. The runtime never reaches into a plugin's
internals; it sees the `PluginModule` contract in `packages/core/src/plugin.ts`. If a change needs an
import against this direction, the design is wrong, not the import rule.

Tests live next to what they test: `packages/engine/test` (kernel), `packages/core/test` (schema validation,
scope), `packages/runtime/test` (the example tree, sabotaged variants, plugin loading, postLoad, the project's
startup steps; and the
branch solver behind `rehearse`), `packages/plugin-http/test` (end to end against a fake upstream),
`packages/plugin-blob/test` (the file store, the CSV parser, the operations), `packages/plugin-reload/test`
(the watcher, and what it does with a tree that refuses), `packages/plugin-auth/test` (sign-in against a directory
and a fake OIDC issuer, the policies over the example's writes, the session across calls and a refresh, the
one-time code on the command line, the plugin's X rules), `packages/plugin-storage/test` (the shipped documents
through the real checker, the `where` grammar, the engine table both ways round and through a copy of the
environment, the handlers driven as the kernel drives them, and the shared suite over a fake engine),
`libraries/access/test` (the access tree alone, and
every A rule sabotaged),
`packages/view/test` (the view model of the example, and the server). The compiler has no test directory of
its own: every checker rule is exercised through the example and its sabotaged variants in
`packages/runtime/test/example.test.ts`. The runtime and the view depend on the http plugin, the http
plugin on the runtime, and the storage plugin on the compiler and the runtime, only as devDependencies, for tests.

## Commands

```
npm install                 # links the workspace
npm run build               # tsc -b, project references, dependency order
npm run lint                # biome: formatting and the house rules (biome.jsonc)
npm run lint:fix            # the same, applying every safe fix
npm test                    # lint, build, then vitest
npx wilanis check example   # the CLI from the built runtime
npx wilanis check libraries/access   # the access tree on its own, with its development binding
npx wilanis start example   # run what its startup declares (the http listener among them)
npx wilanis-view example    # the viewer, on http://127.0.0.1:4400/
npm run release             # publishes every package in dependency order; refuses unless HEAD is tagged schemas-v1 (docs/roadmap.md, RFC 0008)
```

`npm test` must pass before a commit. Tests import the built `dist` of sibling packages, so a change in
core needs a build before its effect shows in a runtime test; `npm test` does that.

## Code quality

Biome lints and formats every `src/` and `test/` file; `biome.jsonc` is the one place the rules live, and says
why each is there. The house rules: a function under 50 lines and a cognitive complexity of 10; a file under
300 lines; at most 4 parameters (an options object beyond that); callbacks nested at most 3 deep; no nested
ternaries; no `!` and no `any` outside a test; a name of at least 2 characters (`_` for an ignored parameter).
A rule that bites is a design signal, not an obstacle: split the function along the steps it takes and name
each, or the file along the rule families it holds. The engine and the compiler are the reference: one class
or module per concern, a one-line doc comment on every public function saying what it answers.

Every directory meets the rules, so `npm run lint` is the whole story: it fails on a violation rather than
warning about one. The two overrides in `biome.jsonc` are not exemptions from the design but facts about the
code -- a test body is one long function and its `describe`/`it` nest, and the view model names a rule's
branches `then` and `otherwise`. Neither is a place to put new debt.

## Principles, and what they mean here

- **DRY.** A rule lives in one place. Document kinds are declared once in `model.ts` and once as a schema;
  the two mirror each other and `validate.ts` joins them. Refusal codes are produced by the checker (D R L
  G P B T A I C S) or a plugin's `check` (X); never duplicate a check in the runtime.
- **Orthogonality.** The engine knows nodes, sources and handlers; it never learns about files, shapes or
  triggers. A file's bytes live in the blob registry (`packages/runtime/src/blobs.ts`) and nowhere else: a
  `blob` value is a handle, codecs stream bodies in and out of the registry, and `@blob` operations stream
  what they read. Never buffer a blob whole beside the store. The compiler knows documents and the engine; it never learns about HTTP. Keep it that way.
  A feature is three directories -- `edge/`, `domain/`, `data/` -- and the directory *is* the layer: the
  checker reads it off the path rather than inferring a role from who references a document. A trigger fires
  a domain port operation through its `fire` run node and never names a graph, so the port is the one seam
  between the edge and the business. A binding says how a port is met and never cares which layer it is in.
  The request is read in three places only: a trigger's `fire.in`, a policy's `decide.in`, and a `resolvers`
  document (edge/) whose named reads a data graph or a binding uses as `{{name}}`. A resolver is a read, never
  an operation; the compiler lowers it to a source reference and nothing runs.
  Who is calling is the guard's business and what they may do is a policy's: the one plugin with a `guard`
  (`@auth`) verifies a credential before any graph runs and adds `request.principal`, `request.session`,
  `request.challenge` to every kind's context; a `policy` (edge/) fires a domain operation over those, and its
  graph refuses with a reason the policy maps to `deny` or `challenge`. A trigger attaches its policies
  in order, and where it attaches one it gives the guard the credentials it verifies (`in: { token: ... }`), read from
  the kind's context like any input; the runtime's embedder runs the gate (`Embedder.gate`), never a kind. No graph
  ever validates a token or a code, and no kind ever checks access.
  A tree may include trees (`project.json → includes`, npm packages only): the loader walks their `features/` as
  if local, marks each document `included`, brings their aliases along, and leaves their connections, plugins and
  settings behind. `libraries/` holds such trees; they are pure JSON with their own tests, and depend on no path
  into this repository, since the packages will move to repositories of their own.
- **Discoverability.** Every refusal has a code, a file, an `at` path and a hint that names the command
  or the edit that fixes it. Every document kind has a schema with descriptions. Every public function has a
  one-line doc comment that says what it answers. Who implements a thing is never a code detail: a domain
  port names its bindings, and a native port says which plugin grants it -- `wilanis describe` prints
  `granted by @http (@wilanis/plugin-http)` and the viewer links its manifest.

## How to change things

- **A new rule.** Add it to its family's module under `packages/compiler/src/check/` -- `project.ts` (C, B at
  the project, startup), `contracts.ts` (shapes, ports, connections), `resolvers.ts` (P), `inputs.ts` (a call
  site's inputs), `bindings.ts` (B), `graph.ts` with `graph-nodes.ts`, `graph-reads.ts`, `graph-whole.ts` and
  `narrowing.ts` (G), `triggers.ts` (T, S), `access.ts` (A), `invariants.ts` (I: what an invariant states
  once and the whole tree is held to) with `invariant-holds.ts` beside it for the field form and `prove.ts`
  for whether a rule already holds where a value is made, `atomic.ts` (the L and G rules about what an
  atomic graph reaches: L009, L010, L011 and G014, gathered there because each is a judgement over the one
  per-profile walk and not over a document) -- give it the next code, write the hint, and add a
  sabotage test in `packages/runtime/test/example.test.ts` that breaks the example and expects the code. What
  every family shares (typing a spec, visibility, the layer a type may name, settings that read secrets only)
  is a method of `Judge` in `check/judge.ts`; a refusal is made through `judge.refuser(file)`. The order the
  families run in is `judgeTree` in `checker.ts`.
- **A new placement rule.** Placement lives in one place: `HOME` in `packages/core/src/placement.ts`, which says
  the layer (or top-level directory) each kind lives in and refuses the rest as D008. Add the kind there, add
  its row to `packages/runtime/templates/CLAUDE.md`, and teach `into()` in `tools.ts` where `wilanis new`
  should write it. A document's layer is read off its path by `layerOf` in `model.ts` -- never inferred from
  what references it.
- **A new document kind.** Schema in `packages/core/schemas/` (with `$id` under the published base and
  `$schema` accepting both forms, and the optional `label` every kind carries), a `*Doc` interface and the
  `Kind` entry in `model.ts`, a row in `packages/runtime/templates/CLAUDE.md`, the baseline in
  `packages/core/test/validate.test.ts`, a `wilanis new` scaffold in `tools.ts`, and a page in the viewer's
  `client/index.html` (`renderDocPage`), since the viewer never shows raw JSON by default.
- **A new include.** A directory under `libraries/`, a workspace member, published as `@wilanis/<name>`: `project.json`
  (its own plugins and aliases; the host reads only the aliases), `features/<name>/` (what a host includes),
  a `-dev` feature and `connections/` that let it check, rehearse and run alone, a `test/` that loads it through
  `loadTree` with the plugins it needs, and a README saying what the host binds and configures. The example
  includes it with `"features": [...]` and binds its ports in a feature of its own. The loader's include walk is
  in `load.ts`; `resolveIncludes` in the runtime's `project.ts` finds the package; tests that copy the example
  hand the include in as `ResolvedInclude` since a copy has no `node_modules`.
- **A new access rule.** Policies and credentials are the `A` family in `check/access.ts` (`checkPolicy`, `checkAccess`);
  the guard's own reasons reach a trigger through `refusalsOfTrigger`. A rule about what the guard hands lives
  in the guard's `plugin.json` (`guard.credentials`, `guard.context`, `guard.refuses`), never in a trigger kind.
  What the `@auth` plugin alone can judge (a challenge method, a session write against the session shape) is its
  `check` (X101-X103).
- **A schema change.** The pull request waits for the maintainer's approval in CI, as a change of decision
  does, because `main` serves the schemas to every tree. Until 1.0: edit in place. After 1.0: compatible,
  edit in place; breaking, the base URL in `model.ts` and every `$id` move to the tag `schemas-v2`, and the
  `schemas-v1` tag stays (RFC 0008).
- **A new plugin.** A new package under `packages/`, depending on core and engine only -- and, where it implements one, the contract plugin it answers -- exporting its
  `PluginModule` as default: `root`, `docs` (the directory of the JSON documents it ships, with
  `plugin.json`; listed in the package's `files`), `handlers`, and optionally `triggers`, `codecs`, `check`
  (its X rules; it refuses with a `Refusal` object: code, file, message, at, hint),
  `postLoad`, and -- for at most one plugin of a tree -- `guard`. Every port, kind, codec or shape a plugin grants is a file under `docs/`, never an object in
  code: what the DSL names, a reader can open. A project names the plugin in `plugins[].from`. Plugins that
  carry an external dependency are always their own package.
- **A new CLI command.** `packages/runtime/src/cli.ts` dispatches; the work goes in `tools.ts` or
  `serve.ts` so it is callable without the CLI.
- **What a tree starts.** Everything a tree starts is declared in `project.json → startup`, never decided by
  the runtime: `wilanis start` runs the plugins' `postLoad`, then those steps, and stops. The HTTP server
  opens because a step names `@http/server.port.json#listen`, so a tree that names none serves nothing.
  An operation that starts something outliving its run is marked `holds` in its port document (beside `pure`
  and `refuses`); it reads `env.hold` to hand back its teardown and `env.serving` to reach the tree, and the
  runtime stops what was held, in reverse, before the `postLoad` teardowns. Only a startup step may name one
  (L008 refuses a graph that runs one), and a native `holds` operation is the one native operation a startup
  step may name (B006 otherwise). `runStartup` and `Served` live in `serve.ts`; `checkStartup` in
  `check/project.ts` judges the steps (B006, B007, B008) and runs last, after the resolvers documents are read.
  A plugin's `postLoad` stays what it is: that plugin's own wiring, not the project's.
- **The project template.** `packages/runtime/templates/` is what `wilanis init` writes into a consumer
  tree. Its `CLAUDE.md` addresses an agent that writes documents, not one that changes this repository.
- **A decision about the code.** It is a file under `fitness/`, one per decision: `claim`, the sentence its
  name spells; `gather`, which reads the repository; `judge`, pure, from what was gathered to the violations,
  each naming the offending file and the edit that fixes it; and `sabotage`, the cases that prove the judge
  bites. `fitness/run.test.ts` registers a claim and its proof for every one; `fitness/lib/` holds readers
  only. **A fitness function that bites is a design signal**: the edit goes to the code, not to `fitness/`.
  Changing a decision is the maintainer's to make and to say -- the `Decision:` line is theirs to write, no
  tool adds it, and `.githooks/commit-msg` and the `decision` job refuse a commit that changes one silently.
  `fitness/README.md` and RFC 0027 are the whole story.

Do not add features, document kinds, or plugin hooks beyond what a task asks for. When a task seems to
need one, stop and say so.

## Commits

Messages are plain: what changed and why, in the imperative. No generated trailers, no tool or session
references. The one exception is a commit that touches `fitness/`, which carries a `Decision: (adds |
reconfigures | retires) fitness/<file> because ...` line saying what was decided and why. That line is the
maintainer's own words; no tool adds it, `.githooks/commit-msg` refuses the commit without it, and the
`decision` job in CI checks every such commit and then waits for the maintainer to approve the run. That job
waits only when there is something to approve: a change of decision, or of a schema under
`packages/core/schemas/`, which `main` serves to every tree; any other pull request skips it.
