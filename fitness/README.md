# fitness

A decision about the TypeScript code of this workspace is one file in this directory. `ls fitness` is the
index, and the file names read as sentences, because a file's name *is* the claim it holds:

```
a-fitness-function-is-one-claim.fitness.ts
```

`CLAUDE.md` states the architecture in sentences -- which way dependencies point, what the engine may import,
that every exported function says what it answers. Biome enforces the house rules and `tsc -b` enforces the
build order; those are fitness functions already. The sentences are not, and a pull request can contradict
one and still pass `npm test`. This directory is where a sentence becomes a test. RFC 0027,
`docs/rfcs/0027-fitness-functions.md`, is the whole design.

## What one looks like

The decision record *is* the file. It opens with three lines:

```ts
/**
 * Claim: the engine imports nothing.
 * Why: the engine knows nodes, sources and handlers and nothing else; a file, a socket or a document kind it
 *   imports is a concern that belongs to core, to a plugin or to the runtime.
 * Retire when: the engine gains a concern that cannot be handed in through a handler or a source, and an RFC
 *   says which.
 */
```

**Claim** is what holds, and is the title the runner gives its test. **Why** names the principle it serves,
in `CLAUDE.md`'s words where it can, and the fact about the code that makes the claim true today. **Retire
when** says what would have to become true for the next reader to delete the file with a clear conscience;
it is the line that decides whether a decision is outdated.

Below the header, a fitness function is a **module, not a test**. It exports four names and registers
nothing:

```ts
/** The claim this module holds, and the title the runner gives its test. */
export const claim = 'the engine imports nothing';

/** Every file under the engine's `src`, with the specifiers it imports. */
export const gather = () => sourceFiles('packages/engine/src').map(file => ({ file, imports: importsOf(file) }));

/** Every import the engine may not have, one sentence each, naming the file and the fix. */
export const judge = (files: ReturnType<typeof gather>): string[] => ...;

/** The proof that the judge bites: a minimal violating input, and the violation it must name. */
export const sabotage = [
  {
    input: [{ file: 'packages/engine/src/kernel.ts', imports: ['node:fs', './spec.js'] }],
    violation: 'packages/engine/src/kernel.ts imports node:fs; move the concern behind a handler or a source',
  },
];
```

Exactly those four, and nothing else: a shared shape is derived with `ReturnType<typeof gather>` rather than
exported as a type, and a helper stays unexported. A builder for a claim's own sabotage inputs is an
unexported function in that file, not a helper in `lib/`.

`fitness/run.test.ts` is the suite's one runner and its only test file. It loads every `*.fitness.ts` with an
eager `import.meta.glob` and gives each module two tests: the **claim**, titled with its sentence, judging
what was gathered and expecting no violation; and the **proof**, `<claim> bites`, feeding the judge every
`sabotage` case and expecting the violation it names. So "one claim, one test, one proof" holds for every
file by construction, and no central file of proofs grows with the suite. A module that does not export all
four is failed by name rather than skipped. A failure reads:

```
 FAIL  fitness/run.test.ts > the engine imports nothing
AssertionError: see fitness/the-engine-imports-nothing.fitness.ts
```

Nothing imports a test file, which is why Biome's `noExportsInTest` stands over `fitness/` with no override.
(Importing from a file that holds `describe`/`it` re-runs its tests in the importer -- which is what that
rule exists to prevent, and why a claim registers nothing of its own.)

## How one is written

- **One claim per file.** A file that needs a second `claim` is two decisions, and the edit is a second file.
- **Facts are data, not branches.** The order of the packages, the one package tested through another, the
  rule table Biome must carry: a constant at the top of the file. Where a fact is already declared elsewhere,
  read it there -- dependency direction reads each `package.json`, the kinds read `KINDS` in
  `packages/core/src/model.ts`. Adding a package or a kind then changes a list, not a decision.
- **Gathering is separate from judging.** `gather` reads the repository and `judge` is pure: it takes what
  was gathered and returns one sentence per violation, naming the offending file and the edit that fixes it.
  That is what lets `sabotage` hand the judge a minimal input and name the violation it expects -- a fitness
  function that has never failed is unproved, and the proof lives in the file it proves.
- **A failure reads like a refusal.** It names the offending file and the edit that fixes it, the way a
  checker refusal carries an `at` and a hint.
- **The full house rules apply.** `biome.jsonc` includes `fitness/**/*.ts` with no override, so a fitness
  function that grows past 50 lines is refused by the tool it defends.

- **The house rules bound the file.** A fitness function past 300 lines is two decisions -- and the edit is a
  second file -- or its reading is general and belongs in `lib/`.

`fitness/lib/` holds **how the repository is read, never what is judged**: a function there takes a path or a
text and returns data. It never returns a violation, never imports vitest, and never knows a claim. It is
therefore not a decision, and a commit changing one needs no `Decision:` line -- the hook and the `decision`
job match `fitness/*.fitness.ts`, which is where a decision lives.
`sources.ts` reads TypeScript as text with Babel's parser (import specifiers, exported declarations, the
comments that lead them, the package a specifier names, the directories under `packages/`), and `jsonc.ts`
reads `biome.jsonc`, the plain JSON of a `tsconfig.json`, and a package's manifest as its name and its
dependency sections.

## Running them

```
npm run fitness      # this suite alone, no build: it reads source text, never dist
npm test             # lint, build, then every project, this one among them
```

`fitness/tsconfig.json` typechecks this directory, since vitest transpiles without checking types and
`tsc -b` covers the packages only. It emits nothing and is not a project reference; both commands above run
it. `npm run fitness` needs no build of its own: delete every `dist` and it still answers, because a claim
reads source text.


## How one is retired

A fitness function is retired when its **Retire when** line has come true -- not when it is inconvenient. A
rule that bites is a design signal: the edit goes to the code, not to this directory.

A commit that touches `fitness/` carries a `Decision:` line saying which of `adds`, `reconfigures` or
`retires`, which file, and why:

```
Retire the engine's import ban in favour of the handler contract

Decision: retires fitness/the-engine-imports-nothing.fitness.ts because RFC 00NN moves sources into the engine.
```

The line is the maintainer's to write, in their own words; no tool adds it, and it is the one exception to
`CLAUDE.md`'s "no generated trailers". Two things hold it. `.githooks/commit-msg`, switched on by
`npm install` through the `prepare` script, refuses the commit without it -- and prints which files under
`fitness/` the commit stages, so the message can be written from what is in front of you. `git commit
--no-verify` skips the hook, as it skips any hook; the `decision` job in CI is what binds: it checks every
commit of the pull request that touches `fitness/`, then waits in an Actions environment named `decisions`
for the maintainer to approve the run. The job is always present and skips itself when the pull request
changes no decision and no schema (a `changes` job reads the pull request's files and says), because
GitHub counts a skipped required check as satisfied and a job filtered out by path never reports at all. A
schema under `packages/core/schemas/` waits at the same gate because `main` serves it to every tree; that
is the one thing the job approves that is not a decision under `fitness/`.
