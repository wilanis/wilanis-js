/**
 * Claim: dependencies point one way.
 * Why: `CLAUDE.md` states the direction as a sentence -- "engine <- core <- compiler <- runtime <- view, and
 *   plugins depend on core and engine only" -- and adds that "if a change needs an import against this rule,
 *   the design is wrong, not the import rule". Nothing read a `package.json` to hold it: an import resolves
 *   because npm hoists the workspace, whichever section declared it, so a `src/` file could reach a package
 *   named only under `devDependencies` for tests, and a plugin could reach the runtime, and everything would
 *   still build, lint and pass. This reads the fact where it lives: a `src/` file may import only what its
 *   own `dependencies` names, a test also its `devDependencies`, and among `@wilanis/*` only what comes
 *   earlier in the order.
 * Retire when: the workspace stops being one npm workspace, or the layering changes and an RFC gives the new
 *   order. Adding a package changes ORDER, which is a list, not a decision.
