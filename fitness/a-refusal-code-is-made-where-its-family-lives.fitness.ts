 * Claim: a refusal code is made where its family lives.
 * Why: `CLAUDE.md` gives each refusal family one home -- "refusal codes are produced by the checker (D R L G
 *   P B T A I C S) or a plugin's `check` (X); never duplicate a check in the runtime" -- and tells anyone
 *   adding a rule to put it in its family's module under `packages/compiler/src/check/`. A code made
 *   somewhere else is the same judgement in two places, which is the DRY rule this repository states first,
 *   and it is how a rule quietly stops being the checker's. Only `src/` is judged: a test carries codes of
 *   every family on purpose, since sabotaging the example is how the checker's rules are proved.
 * Retire when: a family is given a second home on purpose, and the table names it and says why -- as it
 *   already does for the two `D` literals in the runtime's project loader.
