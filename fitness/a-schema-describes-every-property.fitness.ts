/**
 * Claim: a schema describes every property.
 * Why: `CLAUDE.md` says "every document kind has a schema with descriptions", and the schemas are what an
 *   agent reads to write a document: they are served from `main`, every document's `$schema` points at one,
 *   and the viewer draws them. A property with no description is a field a reader must guess at from its name
 *   and its type. The sentence was stated and never held: 93 of 198 properties said nothing, 12 of them by
 *   pointing at a definition that said nothing either, so three sentences on `common.schema.json`'s `$defs`
 *   cleared twelve violations at once. The envelope `wilanis check --json` prints is read the same way: its
 *   schema lives in the runtime, since it is what the runtime's commands print rather than a kind a tree holds
 *   (RFC 0019), and an agent parsing a refusal reads its descriptions as it reads a kind's.
 * Retire when: the descriptions are generated from the `*Doc` interfaces in `model.ts`, or a schema is no
 *   longer what a reader consults to write a document, and an RFC says what is. A `$ref` to a described
 *   definition stays a description: repeating what `common.schema.json` says once is not the goal.
