/**
 * The `where` grammar: a filter as a graph writes it, parsed into the tree an engine compiles. It lives here
 * and not in an engine so that every engine judges the same filter the same way -- the memory one compiles the
 * tree to a predicate, the postgres one to expressions, and neither decides what a filter may say.
 *
 * A filter is an object whose keys are fields of the collection's shape, or one of the three combinators. A
 * field's value is a literal, meaning equality, or a predicate object of one or more operators. A field that
 * is a shape or a list may only be tested with `has`: what lies inside one is not this grammar's business.
 *
 * What is judged here is what the port promises at run time -- an unknown field, an unknown operator, a test a
 * field's type does not admit. Judging a filter before anything runs is RFC 0003's business, in the X band.
