/**
 * `resolves` on a native contract's static field: where a type variable comes from when no call site spells
 * it. The field's literal names a document; the path walks into that document to a value that must be a type
 * reference, and the variable is bound to it.
 *
 * A segment may take a key rather than a fixed name, written two ways and both read left to right:
 * `[input]` takes it from another static input of the same call, so `collections[collection].of` covers every
 * collection of a store; `{sibling}` takes it from a field beside the one just read, so
 * `collections[collection].of{key}.type` follows `of` into the shape it names and takes the field whose name
 * the collection's `key` holds -- which is how a key's type is reached without the port repeating it.
 *
 * A segment that takes its key by an input may name a field to follow where the value found has it:
 * `collections[collection|view].of` reads "take `collections` under the key the input `collection` holds;
 * where what was found has a string field `view`, take `collections` under that instead". One hop only, so a
 * document whose alias points at another alias binds nothing here and is refused where it is written. It is a
 * word of the document being walked, never of the walker: nothing outside this file learns what `view` means.
 *
 * A path that reaches a type reference and keeps going follows it into the shape it names: that is the one
 * place a path leaves the document it started in, and it is what makes the second form worth having.
 *
 * The grammar is deliberately small -- field names, one optional key per segment, no expressions -- and it is
 * parsed in one place so that the checker, the compiler and the gate's stub bind the same variable to the
 * same type. A port document that writes a path outside the grammar is refused when the plugin loads
 * (D011, `contracts.ts`).
