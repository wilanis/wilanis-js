/**
 * A type variable bound from a document rather than from the call site: a plugin whose port resolves $T and
 * $K through a store the tree declares, and a graph that names the store and the collection and nothing else.
 * The three sites that bind a variable are proved to agree here -- the checker holds the call to the type it
 * found, the compiler substitutes the same one into what the operation answers, and a rehearsal's stub
 * generates a value of it -- since a disagreement between them is exactly what one shared resolution prevents.
 *
 * D011 is proved beside them: a port document whose `resolves` is outside the grammar is refused when the
 * plugin loads, and the tree it would have served is never judged.
