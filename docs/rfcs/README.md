# RFCs

Every RFC, one file per item; the roadmap they serve is [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md). RFC 0001 says how this works; `0000-template.md` is what an
RFC is made of. A *stub* holds a roadmap slot and the direction taken, and is expanded before it can be
accepted. Statuses: draft, accepted, implemented, withdrawn.

Which milestone first shows an RFC is said once, in [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md); the tracking issue
carries it as GitHub's milestone. Where this list and the outside assessment that seeded it differ, the
list won: observability moved up, outcome semantics moved down since most of it exists, and higher-level
constructs are challenged in their own stub.
