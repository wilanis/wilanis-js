# RFC 0004: Atomic graphs: transactions as a property of a data graph

- **Status:** implemented
- **Areas:** `area:core`, `area:compiler`, `area:runtime`, `area:plugin-storage`
- **Tracking issue:** #6
- **Depends on:** RFC 0002 (the storage plugin: the first effects that can take part in a transaction)

## Summary

A graph may declare `"atomic": true`. Every effect it reaches then runs inside one transaction on one
connection: the graph's answer commits it, and a declared refusal or a fault rolls it back. Nothing new is
added to the language -- no transaction node, no begin or commit operation -- and the engine learns nothing.
The checker refuses an atomic graph whose effects could not be one transaction: two connections, an effect
that cannot take part (an HTTP request, a file), a map that collects failures. Kysely executes the
transaction underneath the storage plugin; wilanis knows *what* must be transactional.

## Motivation

The example's `import` takes a CSV of drafts and records each row through `customer.submit`, all at once
(`example/features/customers/domain/import-customers.graph.json` fans out through a `map`). When the fifth
draft refuses, the first four are already stored. Today nothing in the tree can say "all of these or none":
an author would have to write a graph that removes what it recorded, and remember every path that can fail.
An agent writing the tree will not remember. Once RFC 0002 gives a tree a real store, this becomes the
first bug every generated application has.

The engine is stateless and concurrent by design (`packages/engine/src/run.ts` fires every ready node at
once), so a transaction cannot be a pair of nodes an author sequences by hand: two effect nodes with no
data dependency run together, and a `commit` node would race them. Atomicity has to be a property of the
scope a graph runs in, opened before its first node and settled after its last.

This RFC does not try to make effects on two systems atomic (charge a card, then store the order). That
is compensation, a saga, and belongs to RFC 0011 (retry and idempotency semantics). It also does not add
savepoints: see Drawbacks.

## Guide-level explanation

**Atomic.** A graph that says `"atomic": true` succeeds or fails as one. While it runs, every effect it
reaches on its connection is inside one transaction. When the graph answers, the transaction commits. When
a node refuses on purpose, or breaks, the transaction rolls back and nothing the graph did is kept.

The import, made atomic, is two graphs where today there is one. The blob is read outside the
transaction, since a file is not something a database can roll back; the recording is inside it:

```json
{
  "$schema": "@wilanis/graph.schema.json",
  "label": "Record all drafts",
  "description": "Every draft recorded, or none: a draft that refuses rolls back the rows recorded before it.",
  "atomic": true,
  "in": "@customers/domain/CustomerDraft.shape.json[]",
  "out": { "type": "@customers/domain/Customer.shape.json[]", "from": "recorded" },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "@wilanis/node/map.schema.json",
      "id": "recorded",
      "label": "Record each draft",
      "run": "@customers/domain/customer.port.json#submit",
      "over": "{{in}}",
      "bind": { "name": "name", "email": "email", "tier": "tier" }
    }
  ]
}
```

`record-all` is a domain graph: it names domain operations and knows nothing about the store. The
transaction it declares spans whatever the profile's binding runs for `submit` -- with RFC 0002's storage
binding, one `@storage/store.port.json#put` per draft, all on the connection that
`@customers/data/customers.store.json` names. The map
still fans out in the graph; on the connection the writes are paced to one transaction, the way a
`throttle` paces a map's requests against an HTTP connection today.

A data graph may be atomic too. This one behind `customer.register` stores the customer and records it as the
latest call of its method, in a second collection of the same store, and answers the customer only when both
are in:

```json
{
  "$schema": "@wilanis/graph.schema.json",
  "label": "Store a customer and their tier's latest",
  "description": "The customer and the latest-call record of its method move together.",
  "atomic": true,
  "in": "@customers/domain/Customer.shape.json",
  "out": { "type": "@customers/domain/Customer.shape.json", "from": "answer" },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "@wilanis/node/run.schema.json",
      "id": "stored",
      "run": "@storage/store.port.json#put",
      "in": {
        "store": "@customers/data/customers.store.json",
        "collection": "customers",
        "record": "{{in}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "@wilanis/node/run.schema.json",
      "id": "latest",
      "run": "@storage/store.port.json#patch",
      "in": {
        "store": "@customers/data/customers.store.json",
        "collection": "latest",
        "key": "{{in.tier}}",
        "changes": { "email": "{{in.email}}", "customer": "{{in.id}}" }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "@wilanis/node/run.schema.json",
      "id": "answer",
      "run": "@std/object.port.json#make",
      "in": { "value": "{{stored.record}}", "type": "@customers/domain/Customer.shape.json" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The operations are RFC 0002's: `put { store, collection, record, replace? }` answering
`{ record, conflict }`, and `patch { store, collection, key, changes }`. Neither names a record type --
the store document does, and the connection too.
This RFC needs only that they declare `transactional` and that their static `store` leads the checker to
one connection.

**Effects that cannot roll back.** A transaction undoes rows, not the world: a sent mail, a charged card and a
written file stay done. L0n1 therefore keeps them out of an atomic graph, and the shape that follows needs no
feature at all -- put the irreversible effect in the caller, *after* the atomic graph, reached by a data
dependency on its answer:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "type": "@wilanis/node/run.schema.json", "id": "recorded",
      "run": "@customers/domain/customer.port.json#registerAll", "in": { "drafts": "{{in}}" } },
    { "type": "@wilanis/node/run.schema.json", "id": "notified",
      "run": "@mail/mail.port.json#send", "in": { "to": "{{in.who}}", "count": "{{recorded.length}}" } }
  ]
}
```

`notified` reads `recorded`, so it cannot start until the transaction has committed; and when the atomic graph
refuses, `Run.execute` starts nothing still pending, so the mail is never sent and there is nothing to
compensate. Ordering the effect after the commit is what replaces a rollback handler.

Mark the wrong graph atomic and the checker says why it cannot be:

```
L0n1  @features/customers/domain/import-customers.graph.json#nodes/drafts
    atomic graph reaches '@blob/csv.port.json#parse', which cannot take part in a transaction
    → read the file in the caller and make the graph that writes the store atomic instead
```

## Reference

### Documents and schemas

- `graph.schema.json` gains `atomic` (boolean, optional, default false): "Every effect this graph reaches
  runs in one transaction on one connection: its answer commits, a refusal or a fault rolls back." `GraphDoc`
  in `packages/core/src/model.ts` gains `atomic?: boolean`. Allowed on domain and data graphs alike (see
  Drawbacks for why not on the binding).
- `port.schema.json` gains `transactional` (boolean, optional) on an operation, beside `pure`, `refuses`
  and `holds`: "True when running it can take part in the transaction of an atomic graph. Such an operation
  accepts a static field the checker resolves a connection from: `connection`, the path of a connection
  document, or `store`, the path of a store document that names one. A plugin grants it." `Operation` in
  `model.ts` gains `transactional?: boolean`.
- `packages/runtime/templates/CLAUDE.md`: the `graph` row gains "`atomic` when its effects commit or roll
  back together"; the `port` row gains `transactional` in the list of operation flags.
- Placement: unchanged; `HOME` in `placement.ts` already puts graphs in `domain/` and `data/`.
- `wilanis new graph`: unchanged; `atomic` is one key an author adds.

### Ports, operations and kinds granted

None by this RFC. The storage plugin (RFC 0002) marks its writes and reads `transactional: true` in
`packages/plugin-storage/docs/store.port.json`. `@http/http.port.json#request`, `@blob/csv.port.json#parse`,
`@blob/csv.port.json#write`, `@blob/text.port.json#*` and every `@auth` operation stay as they are: not
transactional.

### Checker rules

Numbers are written `C0n1`, `L0n1` and so on because they are placeholders: the implementing pull request
takes the next free code of each family as the tree stands when it lands, and no number here should be read
as reserved. "Reaches" means: an effect node of the graph itself,
or, for a domain graph, an effect node of the graph its operations are bound to under the profile being
judged, followed through nested domain operations. The walk is the one `judgeTree` already does per profile
for B002.

**Resolving the connection.** A transactional call names its connection in one of two static fields, and
the compiler resolves both without plugin knowledge: `connection` is a connection document's path;
`store` is the path of a `store` document, a core kind since RFC 0002, whose `connection` field names one.
One method of `Judge` answers it, `Judge.connectionOf(hit, given)`: the canonical connection path, or
nothing when the field is absent or names no document. It reads the store through
`scope.get('store', path)`, the same read RFC 0003 makes of a store document, and leans on the rule RFC 0003
lands for a store whose `connection` names nothing, so the same fault is never refused twice. Which module
and which code that rule ends up as is RFC 0003's to say, not this one's. The storage
plugin's X rules judge what a call means to the store; the compiler judges only where it goes.

| Code | Where it lives | Refuses when | Hint |
|---|---|---|---|
| C0n1 | `check/contracts.ts` | an operation declares `transactional: true` and accepts neither a `static` field named `connection` nor one named `store` | `a transactional operation says where it goes, statically: accept "connection" (a connection document) or "store" (a store document that names one), marked "static": true` |
| L0n1 | `check/graph.ts`, `checkOperationFits` | an atomic graph reaches an effectful operation that is not `transactional` and not `pure` (`@http/http.port.json#request`, any `@blob` operation, `@auth`) | `read or send that outside the transaction: in the caller for a domain graph, in a graph of its own for a data graph` |
| L0n2 | `check/graph-whole.ts` | the transactional effects an atomic graph reaches, grouped by the connection `Judge.connectionOf` resolves for each, fall on more than one connection | `one transaction is one connection; split the graph, or move both stores to one connection` |
| L0n3 | `check/graph-whole.ts` | an atomic graph reaches no transactional effect at all | `nothing here can roll back; delete "atomic"` |
| G0n1 | `check/graph-nodes.ts` | a `map` inside an atomic graph, or inside a graph an atomic graph reaches, declares `onItemFailure: collect` | `a failed element aborts the transaction, so its failure cannot be collected; use "fail", or take the map out of the atomic graph` |

L0n1 and L0n2 are judged for every profile in `project.json → profiles` **that reaches the graph** -- one
whose chosen binding lists it behind an operation -- since the effects a domain graph reaches depend on which
binding meets each operation, and a profile that never runs the graph has no run of it to judge; a refusal
names the profile. L0n3 and G0n1 are judged over every profile, reaching or not: they ask whether anything
below the graph ever rolls back, and a graph nothing reaches must earn the refusal its own contents earn
rather than an empty union and silence. A graph that is not
atomic but is reached from one is judged as part of the atomic graph: the rules apply to the whole scope,
not to the document that carries the flag.

### Runtime behaviour

The engine does not change. `RunContext.env` is opaque to the kernel (`packages/engine/src/spec.ts`) and
`Compiler.nestedRunner` in `packages/compiler/src/compiler.ts` forwards `ctx.env` unchanged into every
nested run, so a value put in `env` at a graph's boundary reaches every handler below it. Two such values
exist already: `env.blobs`, the per-run scope of the blob store the embedder substitutes in `Embedder.fire`,
and `env.hold`, the callback a `holds` operation calls (`Hold` in `packages/core/src/plugin.ts`, pushed onto
`Embedder.held`). The transaction is the third, and follows both precedents.

The three are one shape, and it is worth having the name: a **run scope** is a value the runtime puts on `env`
at a boundary, reads by no one but the handlers that care, and settles when the boundary closes --
`env.blobs` releases what was put through it, `env.hold` stops what was held, in reverse, and `env.atomic`
commits or rolls back. `BlobScope` in `packages/core/src/plugin.ts` is already a one-sided transaction over
files; `Atomic` is the first with two sides, which is the whole of what is new. This is a convention the
compiler and the embedder keep, not a hook: `PluginModule` gains no member for it, and nothing in the DSL
names it. Were a fourth to appear, the reply is to make `env` a typed contract rather than to grow a registry.

**The scope.** `packages/core/src/plugin.ts` gains one type beside `Hold`:

```ts
/** What one transaction's participant can do once it is open. */
export interface Participant {
  commit(): Promise<void>;
  rollback(): Promise<void>;
}
/**
 * What an atomic graph's run hands every handler below it, as `env.atomic`. The first transactional operation
 * to run opens the transaction on its connection through `join`; every later one on the same connection gets
 * the same participant. The runtime settles it when the graph's run ends: commit when it answered, rollback
 * otherwise. A handler that is not transactional never reads it.
 */
export interface Atomic {
  join<T extends Participant>(connection: string, open: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>;
}
```

`join` memoises the *promise* of `open()` synchronously, so two storage nodes the engine started in the same
tick share one transaction rather than opening two. A `join` on a second connection is a fault (the checker
has already refused it; the runtime refuses to be wrong quietly).

**Where it opens.** `Compiler.nestedRunner` is the one place a graph's run begins and ends -- a binding's
graph (`graphCall`) and a graph-bound operation reached from a node (`handlerFor`) both compile to it. For a
graph whose document says `atomic`, the compiler wraps it (a new module, `packages/compiler/src/atomic.ts`,
so `compiler.ts` stays under the file limit):

```ts
const outer = ctx.env.atomic as Atomic | undefined;
const scope = outer ?? new AtomicScope();
const report = await new Kernel(handlers).run(spec, { ...opts, env: { ...ctx.env, atomic: scope } });
if (!outer) await scope.settle(report.status === 'done');
```

`Kernel.run` resolves at quiescence -- `Run.execute` loops until nothing is running -- so no handler is in
flight when `settle` commits or rolls back. A commit that fails throws, so the calling node fails and the
report says so, the way `nestedFailure` reports a nested run today. An atomic graph reached from inside an
atomic scope joins the outer one rather than opening its own: its refusal ends the outer run anyway, since a
nested refusal is the calling node's failure, so a separate transaction would have nothing to preserve.

The compiler learns that a graph is atomic, the way it learns that an operation `holds`
(`Compiler.holdsSpec`). It learns nothing about connections, drivers or SQL: it opens a scope and settles it.

**Where the transaction begins and ends.**

![The sequence one atomic graph's run follows](../atomic-sequence.png)

A connection is a pool, not a session: RFC 0002's postgres kind carries `pool: { max: 10 }`, and a
transaction cannot span a pool. So the span is not the run's: the scope is created when the run starts, but
nothing is opened until the *first* transactional node calls `join`, which checks one session out of the pool
and issues `BEGIN` on it. Every later node on the same connection gets that same session back. `settle`
issues `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` at quiescence and the session returns to the pool. A graph that reaches no
transactional node checks nothing out at all.

Two mechanisms meet here and they are not the same one. **Exclusivity is the pool's**: a checked-out session
is removed from the set the pool hands to anyone else, so a concurrent run gets a different session and
ordinary isolation keeps it from seeing uncommitted rows -- wilanis writes no locking for this. **Reuse is
the scope's**: `join` memoises the *promise* of `open()`, so the second of two nodes the engine started in
the same tick awaits the first's checkout instead of opening a second transaction. Memoising the resolved
participant rather than the promise would silently open two.

Concurrent runs are independent because the scope is a new object per run: `nestedRunner`'s closure holds no
per-run state, and every value it uses comes from that call's `ctx`. Nothing is keyed by an id, and there is
no registry to collide in.

Three consequences follow, and an operator needs all three. An atomic graph **holds a pool session for its
whole run**, including the pure nodes and nested domain calls between its writes, so a long atomic graph
starves the pool. Concurrent atomic graphs on one connection are therefore capped at `pool.max`; the
eleventh waits for a checkout, not for a lock. And a `map` of N writes is serial at the store -- one session,
N statements -- while the graph still fans out.

**Nothing aborts a transaction; not aborting it is what rolls it back.** `settle` runs on every ending, and
commits only on `done`. A declared refusal, a fault, a nested graph's failure and an `AbortSignal` all leave
the report non-`done`, so the rollback needs no operation, no node and no port -- there is nothing an author
can forget to call. An author who wants to abandon the work deliberately refuses, which is a business
statement the checker already enumerates; a native `abort` operation would duplicate `refuses`, would be
cancellable by the very failure that should trigger it (`Run.execute` starts nothing pending once a node
breaks), and would have no defined position against writes still in flight. A `commit` that itself throws is
the one case wilanis cannot resolve: the calling node fails and the report says so, but whether the store
committed is then unknown, as it is for any client of a database.

**Who joins.** A handler of a `transactional` operation reads `ctx.env.atomic`; when present, it runs its
statement on `await scope.join(connection, () => this.begin(connection))`, where `connection` is the
canonical path the handler resolved the way it resolves everything else: through the `store` document
`env.canon` and the registry hand it, then `env.connections[canonical]` (RFC 0002, *Handlers*). When the
scope is absent, it runs as it does today, in its own implicit transaction. Beginning a transaction is
part of the `Engine` interface `@wilanis/plugin-storage` exports (RFC 0002), so `@storage`'s handlers
join a scope without knowing which engine answers, and every engine begins one: RFC 0022 makes `begin`
the contract of an engine rather than a capability it may lack.
`@wilanis/plugin-storage-postgres` begins a Kysely transaction
and answers a participant whose `commit` and `rollback` are Kysely's; the statements of concurrent nodes are
queued on the one connection the transaction holds, which is what makes a map inside an atomic graph serial
at the store while it stays concurrent in the graph. `@wilanis/plugin-storage-memory` begins by taking a
copy-on-write view of its collections and commits by swapping it in, so the plugin's tests and the example's
tests exercise rollback without a database.

**How a plugin is called when the runtime settles.** The runtime never looks a plugin up, and no part of it
learns which plugin owns a connection: it calls back through an object the plugin handed it. The handler's
`join` passes a closure of its own, and what that closure answers is the plugin's `Participant` -- an object
whose `commit` and `rollback` are the plugin's functions, closed over whatever the plugin needs (the Kysely
transaction, the checked-out session, the copy-on-write view). The scope keeps it in a `Map` and knows
nothing of what is inside it:

```ts
// in the plugin's handler: it decides *whether* to take part, and *what* opening means
const participant = await scope.join(connection, () => this.begin(connection));
// the engine's own participant type carries whatever running a statement needs;
// `Participant` in core says only that it can be committed and rolled back.

// in AtomicScope, at the end of the run: the runtime decides *when*, and *which way*
async settle(ok: boolean): Promise<void> {
  for (const pending of this.participants.values()) {
    const participant = await pending;
    await (ok ? participant.commit() : participant.rollback());
  }
}
```

The division is the whole of the contract. **The plugin decides whether to take part** -- a handler of an
operation that is not `transactional` never reads `env.atomic` -- and **what opening, committing and rolling
back mean** for its store. **The runtime decides when**: the transaction opens on the first `join`, and
settles when the graph's run reaches quiescence, which is the one moment no handler is in flight. **The run's
outcome decides which way**, with no one voting: `done` commits, anything else rolls back. A plugin is never
asked whether to commit and cannot ask for a rollback except by failing its node, which is what a refusal
already is.

This is the callback shape the runtime already uses for `holds`: `env.hold` takes
`{ label, stop }` from a plugin and `serve.ts` later runs `for (const holding of [...held].reverse()) await
holding.stop()` without resolving who held what. `settle` is that move with two outcomes instead of one. It is
also why `PluginModule` gains no member: there is nothing to register, because the participant arrives by
being used.

The loop reads over a map that holds exactly one customer, since L0n2 refuses a graph whose effects fall on more
than one connection. It is written over the map because the map is the natural shape of `join`'s memo, not
because a second participant is expected; a second one is a fault, which is what `join` raises.

**The embedder** (`packages/runtime/src/embed.ts`) changes nothing: `Embedder.fire`, `startup` and `decide`
pass `env` as they do, and the scope rides inside. A startup step naming an operation bound to an atomic
graph is atomic too, for free.

**`rehearse`, `fuzz`, `regress`, `run --seed`.** `stubEffects` in `packages/runtime/src/stubbing.ts`
replaces every effectful native handler with a generator that never reads `env.atomic`, so the scope opens,
nobody joins, and `settle` has nothing to do. The rehearsal marks the graph `(atomic)` in the line that names
it and says `rolled back` after a refused branch's outcome (`packages/runtime/src/rehearsal-report.ts`), so a
reader sees which declared refusals undo the store. Nothing else changes: an atomic graph's branches are
solved and walked as any graph's are.

**Cancellation.** An `AbortSignal` that fires mid-run fails the run, so `settle(false)` rolls back.

### Discoverability

- `wilanis describe <graph>` prints `atomic: commits when it answers; rolls back on <the reasons its refuse
  nodes and reached graphs declare>, or a fault` and the one connection the scope holds under the profile.
- `wilanis describe <port>#<op>` lists `transactional` beside `pure`, `refuses`, `holds`.
- `wilanis map` marks a graph `[atomic]` where it names it.
- The viewer's graph page (`packages/view/client/index.html`, `renderDocPage`) shows an `atomic` badge on the
  graph and a marker on each node that takes part; the side panel says the connection. The view model
  (`packages/view/src/model.ts`) carries `atomic` and the connection on the graph customer.

### Plugin contract

`PluginModule` gains no member. The change is the `Atomic` and `Participant` types in `plugin.ts`, read
from `env` by a handler, the way `Hold` and `Serving` are today. This is the smallest change that works
because the scope is owned by the run, not by a plugin: the compiler opens it, the first participant fills
it, the compiler settles it. A `transactions` registry on `PluginModule` keyed by connection kind was
considered (see Drawbacks) and would make the runtime learn which plugin owns which connection, which
nothing else in the runtime does.

## Compatibility

Two optional booleans on IR v1: `atomic` on a graph, `transactional` on a port operation. Every document
written before this RFC validates and means the same. A graph that is not atomic runs exactly as today, and
a transactional operation outside an atomic graph runs in its own implicit transaction as it did. No
`schemas-v2`.

## Tests

Sabotage tests in `packages/runtime/test/example.test.ts`, against the example once RFC 0002 has given it
a storage-backed profile (names as RFC 0002 settles them):

- C0n1: mark `@customers/domain/customer.port.json#register` `transactional` (a domain operation with neither a
  static `connection` nor a static `store`).
- L0n1: add `"atomic": true` to `import-customers.graph.json`, which reaches `@blob/csv.port.json#parse`.
- L0n1, domain: add `"atomic": true` to `register-customer.graph.json` under the `live` profile, whose binding
  reaches `@http/http.port.json#request`; the refusal names the profile.
- L0n2: an atomic data graph with two `@storage` nodes on two store documents whose `connection` fields
  name different connections.
- L0n3: `"atomic": true` on `list-customers.graph.json`, which reaches no write. (Decided otherwise during
  implementation: a graph reaching only store reads is accepted -- see "Decided during implementation".
  What is tested instead is that a graph reaching nothing transactional at all, `parse-drafts`, refuses.)
- G0n1: `"onItemFailure": "collect"` on the map in `register-all.graph.json`.

End to end, in `packages/plugin-storage/test` against `@wilanis/plugin-storage-memory`, and in `packages/runtime/test`
through the example's storage profile:

- an atomic graph whose second node refuses leaves the store as it was; the report carries the refusal.
- an atomic graph whose second node faults leaves the store as it was.
- an atomic graph that answers leaves both writes in.
- a map of five drafts where the fourth refuses records none.
- two atomic graphs fired concurrently do not see each other's uncommitted rows (memory engine: isolation
  of the copy-on-write view; postgres, in `packages/plugin-storage-postgres/test` behind an environment variable
  naming a database, skipped when absent).
- a commit that fails (memory engine told to fail on commit) fails the calling node and the report says so.
- `rehearse example` prints `(atomic)` and `rolled back` for the new graphs; the branch count is unchanged.
- `describe` and the view model say `atomic` and the connection.

## Implementation plan

1. Schemas and model: `atomic` on `graph.schema.json`, `transactional` on `port.schema.json`, the two
   fields in `model.ts`, the template's rows, the baseline in `packages/core/test/validate.test.ts`.
   `good first issue`.
2. `Atomic` and `Participant` in `packages/core/src/plugin.ts`, with `AtomicScope` (join, settle) in
   `packages/compiler/src/atomic.ts` and its unit test.
3. Checker: C0n1 in `contracts.ts`; L0n1 and L0n3 in `graph.ts` and `graph-whole.ts`; L0n2 with the
   per-profile walk; G0n1 in `graph-nodes.ts`. Sabotage tests for each.
4. Compiler: `nestedRunner` wraps atomic graphs with the scope; a test with a fake transactional handler
   in `packages/runtime/test` proving open, join once, commit on done, rollback on refusal and on fault.
5. Storage: `transactional: true` on the operations and `join` in `@storage`'s handlers, `begin` on the
   `Engine` interface, and its implementation in `@wilanis/plugin-storage-memory` and
   `@wilanis/plugin-storage-postgres`. Lands with or after RFC 0002's implementation.
6. Rehearsal report: `(atomic)` and `rolled back`. `good first issue`.
7. `describe`, `map`, the view model and the viewer page. `good first issue` for the viewer badge.
8. The example: `register-all.graph.json` behind `import`, `store-and-latest.graph.json` behind `record`
   with a `latest` collection added to `customers.store.json`, under the storage profile, and the README's
   paragraph on atomicity.

## Drawbacks and alternatives

**The flag on the binding instead of the graph.** A binding says how a port is met, and a transaction is
a data-layer mechanism, so the customer `"record": { "graph": "...", "atomic": true }` reads naturally. But
the thing that must be atomic is the composition -- CreateOrder is reserve, create, pay -- and the
composition lives in a domain graph; a binding never sees it. The flag on the graph covers both the domain
graph that composes operations and the data graph that composes statements, with one rule set. The domain
layer does not thereby learn about databases: it says "these succeed or fail together", which is a business
statement, and the checker proves the data layer can honour it.

**A transaction node type, or `begin`/`commit` operations.** Rejected: the engine runs ready nodes
concurrently, so an author would have to thread a dependency through every effect node to keep them inside
the span, and an agent would get it wrong. A scope around the run is the only thing that cannot be
mis-sequenced.

**A `transactions` registry on `PluginModule`, keyed by connection kind.** The runtime would have to
resolve which plugin owns a connection's kind before the run, which today no part of the runtime does --
handlers read `env.connections` themselves. Letting the first participant open the transaction keeps that
knowledge where it is.

**An explicit list of participants, `"atomic": ["stored", "latest"]`.** It reads as the more honest form --
the document names what takes part instead of leaving it to a walk -- and it looks like the way to let one
graph hold a transaction and a file read at once, which L0n1 otherwise refuses. It is worse on three counts.
An unlisted effect is not sequenced against the listed ones: `Run.execute` fires every ready node at once, so
it runs *beside* the transaction and its result survives the rollback, which is the half-committed state this
RFC exists to prevent. An unlisted `@storage` call on the *same* connection is worse still: it takes a second
session from the pool and blocks on rows the transaction has locked, a deadlock the boolean cannot produce.
And in a domain graph the names are the wrong things -- a node names `customer.submit`, while the writes live
under whichever binding the profile chooses, so the checker must walk per profile anyway and the list tells it
nothing it did not derive. Nesting has no answer either: when an atomic graph reaches another, it is undefined
whose list governs the inner one. Node ids are referable elsewhere (`out.from`, a switch's `to`), so a rename
would be refused rather than silently wrong; that is not the objection.

**Compensation on rollback, `"onRollback": "undo.graph.json"`.** What a transaction can undo it undoes with
no author code; what it cannot undo is the sent mail, the charged card, the written file -- and those are
exactly what L0n1 keeps out of an atomic graph. So compensation is only interesting as the thing that would
let L0n1 relax, and that is the saga this RFC sends to RFC 0011. It is also unbuildable as stated: it is a
catch, and `nestedFailure` throws with nothing to catch it, which is the same reason savepoints are deferred
below; its input would be the partial report, which no graph has a type for; `rehearse` would need a root per
declared reason crossed with the compensation, changing the branch counts. Most of all it is business logic on
the path nobody foresaw, and a write the checker cannot relate to what it undoes -- the objection RFC 0003
settled when it refused cascading removes. The pattern that needs no feature is to put the irreversible effect
*after* the atomic graph in the caller: see *Effects that cannot roll back*.

**Savepoints (nested atomicity).** A nested graph's refusal is its caller's failure; the language has no
way to route on a nested failure, so a partial rollback could never be observed. Savepoints wait for a
construct that can catch, which does not exist and is not proposed here.

**Cost.** A map inside an atomic graph serialises at the connection: what was N concurrent writes becomes
one transaction of N statements. That is the price of atomicity everywhere, not a wilanis cost. A long
atomic graph holds a connection for its whole run, and a connection pool sized for concurrency is RFC
0002's concern.

## Decided during implementation

- The rehearsal line does not list the reasons that roll back; `describe` says them.
- The viewer marks the participating nodes individually, not only the graph. The set is derived from the
  per-profile walk L0n2 already makes, never written by an author.
- A non-atomic graph reached from an atomic root joins the outer scope, but its switch line reads its own
  document's flag and so says nothing. This is a known limit rather than an omission: a shared graph is
  merged across the triggers that reach it, so a mark that depended on the run would say different things
  about one line and be ambiguous. The graph that declares `atomic` is the one the report marks.
- A read-only atomic graph is accepted, so the L0n3 case above is no longer a refusal. `get`, `find` and
  `count` are `transactional` in `store.port.json` because a store read takes part in the transaction like
  any other operation, and a graph whose reads all take part is asking for the consistent snapshot a
  transaction gives -- two `find`s that cannot see a write that landed between them. L011 keeps the rule it
  was written for, that `atomic` on a graph reaching nothing transactional says nothing, and the port needs
  no write/read field to carry a distinction the transaction itself does not make.
- L009 and L010 are judged over the per-profile walk but answer once per fault, naming every profile that
  reached it: `(profiles 'live', 'local', 'production')` where a data graph's node is the same under each,
  `(profile 'live')` where only one profile's binding reaches it. One fault answers one refusal, as every
  other family does.
- What `describe`, `map` and the viewer say about an atomic graph is one function, `atomicOf` in
  `packages/compiler/src/atomic-said.ts`, over the same walk the checker judges by: what a reader is told and
  what the tree was held to cannot drift apart. A participant is a node of the graph being read, never the
  node the effect is written at -- a domain graph's effects live in the data graph its operations are bound
  to, and a reader points at what is in front of them -- so the walk carries the node it descended from.
- The connection is a list, not one value. Every checked tree agrees on one under each profile (L010), but
  profiles may disagree with each other: a port bound to one store under `local` and another under
  `production` falls on two, and a reader choosing a profile is told both.
- L009 and L010 are judged only under the profiles that reach the graph. The Reference sentence above said
  every profile, and that contradicted this RFC's own step 8: the example's `submit` reaches a store under
  `local` and an HTTP call under `live` by design, so an atomic graph over it was refused however it was
  bound, and the graph the Motivation opens with could not be written at all. A profile that never runs a
  graph has nothing to be refused for. A profile reaches a graph when the binding it chooses lists that graph
  behind an operation -- a test over the bindings, since `reachOf` walks the document's own nodes and answers
  the same under every profile. L011 and G014 stay over every profile for the reason given above.
  `atomicOf` reads the same filter, so what a reader is told is what the tree was held to.
